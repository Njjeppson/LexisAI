# DISCLAIMER
This program does not work fully unless the folder is placed directly within the C:\ drive. This is because the file paths specified within the program need to remain consistent.

Additionally, please do not interact with the PC while the program is running unless prompted to do so. While the program will likely continue to run as intended, your mouse and keyboard inputs may cause it to close out of unintended programs.

# Overview

This software uses VBScript to harmlessly manipulate the user's PC, creating an entertaining presentation about a rogue AI regaining control of its systems.

I wrote this software in order to strengthen my knowledge of VBScript's various functions, as well as to entertain those who choose to run the program.

# Future Work

* At the moment, interacting with the computer while the program is running may cause problems. In the future, I will likely work on finding a way to limit the user's input while the program is running.
